# Shared Elements Transition for Jetpack Compose

Originated from [mobnetic/compose-shared-element](https://github.com/mobnetic/compose-shared-element).

Shared elements transition implementation for compose with various customization options.
Currently providing the following transition patterns:
* Standard shared elements transition
* [Material container transform](https://material.io/design/motion/the-motion-system.html#container-transform) (which basically mimics the [`MaterialContainerTransform`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/transition/MaterialContainerTransform) of MDC-Android library)

## Download

While this library is highly experimental, if you want to use it, [snapshot versions](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/mxalbert/sharedelements/shared-elements/) are available at Sonatype OSSRH's snapshot repository. These are updated on every commit to `main`.
To use it:
```Kotlin
repositories {
    // ...
    maven("https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots")  // build.gradle.kts
    maven { url 'https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }  // build.gradle
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.mxalbert.sharedelements:shared-elements:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

## How to use

1. Define elements with the same `key` and different `screenKey`s using `SharedElement` or `SharedMaterialContainer` composables.
2. Wrap different screens in a single `SharedElementRoot`.

Transition will start when elements with the same key are detected.

## Notes

* `SharedElementsTransitionSpec` of the start element will be used.
* Transition is only applied to the shared elements, so you have to define the transition for the rest yourself. See the [demo](demo) for examples. If you want to prevent an element from showing in your self-defined transition, call `prepareTransition(key)`.
* Elements are composed separately in an overlay during transition, so `remember` won't work as expected. If your element is stateful, define the state outside the `SharedElement` or `SharedMaterialContainer` composables.
* If the element is root element (i.e. direct child of `SharedElementRoot`) and is full-screen (e.g. has `Modifier.fillMaxSize()`), specifying `isFullscreen = true` on it can greatly improve performance and allows you to use stateful composables.
